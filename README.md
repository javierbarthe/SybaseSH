Shell Scripts for Sybase ASE/IQ/RS Administration and Monitoring

Hi all, after 10 years of scripting as a Sybase DBA I decide to upload all my scripts here and make them public. 
Please donÂ´t take them as final scripts, you may find some issues but would be of help for a fresh start.
If you find it usefull please comment, review or just make me a recomendation on linkedin profile.
